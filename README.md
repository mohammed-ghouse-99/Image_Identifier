# Fashion MNIST Image Classifier API (FastAPI)

This is a simple web application built using **FastAPI** that allows users to upload images and classify them into one of the 10 Fashion MNIST categories. The backend uses a trained PyTorch model to predict the clothing type from grayscale images.

>  This project was developed with step-by-step guidance from [ChatGPT by OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/), including architecture design, code, and deployment suggestions.
